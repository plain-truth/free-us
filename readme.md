Dear Fellow Americans,

For over fifty years, our unworthy leaders have brought us down a meandering path to ruin. They have divided us, manipulated us, and now they believe that they control us.

The time has come for us to decide whether We will stand united or let them bury us apart.

We have the fire that will light the way to fellowship, balance, and freedom. At the appropriate time, this repository will be updated with the only other thing We need: a map. With hearts ablaze and map in hand, the way will become clear.

The great endeavor of our time is about to begin. To stay connected and participate in the future, throw your hat into the arena by forking, starring, and watching this repository.

The bell of democracy rings out for your help. Will you answer the call?

Your humble servant,
Plain Truth
